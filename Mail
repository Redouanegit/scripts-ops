Subject: Request for a Meeting to Investigate Traffic Manager Performance Issue

Hi [Team Name],

I hope you're doing well.

We're currently investigating a performance issue affecting file downloads from our Artifactory instance. While users in Paris are experiencing normal speeds, those connecting from New York are reporting significantly slower download rates.

Initial tests suggest that latency is not the root cause, and the issue may be related to how Traffic Manager is routing or handling traffic to the affected region.

Would it be possible to schedule a meeting with your team to analyze this further together? Please let us know your availability this week, and weâ€™ll be happy to coordinate accordingly.

Thanks in advance for your support.

Best regards,
