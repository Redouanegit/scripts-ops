Subject: Request for Exception to Add OCS Instances (HAProxy Nodes) as Members of the Traffic Manager

Hello [Traffic Manager Team / Name],

As part of our efforts to improve the high availability and performance of our JFrog cluster, we have been exploring alternatives to the current SLB service, which has shown some technical limitations—particularly regarding slow artifact downloads from regions outside Paris.

We have deployed a proof of concept using HAProxy in a 4-node OCS setup, which provides greater control over load balancing and improves service resilience. This configuration would also allow us to maintain effective regional failover via Traffic Manager.

However, adding these HAProxy nodes to the Traffic Manager is currently restricted by an architectural policy that only allows SLB instances as DNS members.

That said, we are aware that from a technical standpoint, it is entirely feasible to include OCS nodes in the Traffic Manager. Therefore, we are formally requesting an exception to allow the addition of these HAProxy instances as DNS members, strictly for evaluation purposes and within a controlled environment.

Our goals with this request are:

To assess the benefits in terms of performance, control, and reliability;

And to reduce our dependency on SLB components, which we currently have limited control over.


We remain available to present the proposed architecture in more detail and to coordinate closely with your team for monitoring and review.

Looking forward to your feedback,
Best regards,




Hello [Traffic Manager Team / Name],

Following our recent discussions, and based on the feedback received from your team, we understand that it is technically feasible to register OCS instances (in our case, HAProxy nodes) as members of the Traffic Manager, even though current architecture guidelines restrict it to SLB-only membership.

As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the availability and performance of our JFrog cluster, we conducted a proof of concept using HAProxy (in a non-HA 4-node OCS setup). This test has yielded significantly improved artifact download times, especially from regions outside Paris, where we previously experienced performance degradation with the current SLB-based configuration.

In this context, we kindly request an exception to allow our HAProxy nodes to be registered in the Traffic Manager, for the purpose of DNS-based traffic routing across regions. This would enable us to benefit from improved performance and better control of our traffic distribution strategy.

Should such an exception not be possible due to architectural or policy constraints, we would appreciate it if your team could propose an alternative DNS-based routing mechanism that would allow us to achieve similar functionality and regional failover behavior — without relying on SLB.

We are available to provide all relevant technical documentation and coordinate closely with your team for implementation and testing.

Looking forward to your response.
Best regards,
