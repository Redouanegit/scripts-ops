Subject: Request for Exception to Add OCS Instances (HAProxy Nodes) as Members of the Traffic Manager

Hello [Traffic Manager Team / Name],

As part of our efforts to improve the high availability and performance of our JFrog cluster, we have been exploring alternatives to the current SLB service, which has shown some technical limitations—particularly regarding slow artifact downloads from regions outside Paris.

We have deployed a proof of concept using HAProxy in a 4-node OCS setup, which provides greater control over load balancing and improves service resilience. This configuration would also allow us to maintain effective regional failover via Traffic Manager.

However, adding these HAProxy nodes to the Traffic Manager is currently restricted by an architectural policy that only allows SLB instances as DNS members.

That said, we are aware that from a technical standpoint, it is entirely feasible to include OCS nodes in the Traffic Manager. Therefore, we are formally requesting an exception to allow the addition of these HAProxy instances as DNS members, strictly for evaluation purposes and within a controlled environment.

Our goals with this request are:

To assess the benefits in terms of performance, control, and reliability;

And to reduce our dependency on SLB components, which we currently have limited control over.


We remain available to present the proposed architecture in more detail and to coordinate closely with your team for monitoring and review.

Looking forward to your feedback,
Best regards,




Hello [Traffic Manager Team / Name],

Following our recent discussions, and based on the feedback received from your team, we understand that it is technically feasible to register OCS instances (in our case, HAProxy nodes) as members of the Traffic Manager, even though current architecture guidelines restrict it to SLB-only membership.

As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the availability and performance of our JFrog cluster, we conducted a proof of concept using HAProxy (in a non-HA 4-node OCS setup). This test has yielded significantly improved artifact download times, especially from regions outside Paris, where we previously experienced performance degradation with the current SLB-based configuration.

In this context, we kindly request an exception to allow our HAProxy nodes to be registered in the Traffic Manager, for the purpose of DNS-based traffic routing across regions. This would enable us to benefit from improved performance and better control of our traffic distribution strategy.

Should such an exception not be possible due to architectural or policy constraints, we would appreciate it if your team could propose an alternative DNS-based routing mechanism that would allow us to achieve similar functionality and regional failover behavior — without relying on SLB.

We are available to provide all relevant technical documentation and coordinate closely with your team for implementation and testing.

Looking forward to your response.
Best regards,









Subject: Request for Exception to Integrate HAProxy Nodes into Traffic Manager for Improved DNS-Based Routing

Dear Traffic Manager Team,

Following our recent discussions and technical assessments, we would like to formally request an exception to allow the integration of OCS instances (HAProxy nodes) as members of the Traffic Manager for DNS-based routing.

We have successfully completed a proof of concept using HAProxy to load balance traffic between our two JFrog servers in a development environment. The results have been very positive—especially in terms of download speeds for users outside the Paris region, which were significantly improved compared to the current setup.

As part of this initiative, we are proposing a new target architecture where the Traffic Manager will route DNS requests directly to HAProxy instances deployed in high availability mode. These HAProxy nodes (4 instances per AZ) will be configured with Keepalived to manage two Virtual IPs (VIPs) per Availability Zone.

Here is a visual overview of the target architecture:



During our exchanges, it was confirmed by your team that technically it is feasible to add OCS instances to the Traffic Manager, but we understand this has been restricted due to architectural policies. Given the performance benefits observed, we kindly ask you to reconsider this restriction or, alternatively, provide us with an officially supported DNS-based routing solution that would allow us to bypass the use of SLBs.

Your support on this matter would help us significantly improve artifact delivery performance for remote regions while simplifying our infrastructure.

We remain available to further discuss or clarify the approach and provide detailed POC results if needed.
