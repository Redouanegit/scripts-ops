Impact Analysis â€“ Migration from SLB to HAProxy with TrafficManager Constraints

1. Current Architecture Overview

Primary JFrog Cluster:

Deployed in fr-paris, spread across two Availability Zones.

Fronted by two managed SLBs (Service Load Balancers).


Disaster Recovery (DR) Cluster:

Deployed in fr-north, also behind a managed SLB.


TrafficManager:

A global DNS-based routing service.

Performs health-based failover between the 3 SLBs (2 in fr-paris, 1 in fr-north).

Accepts only SLBs as members, not static IPs or custom instances.

2. Objective of the Change

Due to observed instabilities or dysfunctions in the SLB service, evaluate the feasibility and impact of replacing the SLBs in fr-paris with HAProxy, a self-managed load balancing solution.



---

3. Key Impact Areas

3.1 Compatibility with TrafficManager

Critical Limitation: TrafficManager only supports SLB-type resources as routing targets.

Impact: Replacing SLBs directly with HAProxy (standalone) would render TrafficManager unable to route traffic to the primary cluster.

Mitigation:

Deploy HAProxy instances behind a lightweight SLB to maintain TrafficManager compatibility.

SLB acts as a passthrough proxy (L4 or L7) to HAProxy.




---

3.2 Network & Connectivity

Impact: Existing firewall rules and security groups are configured for SLB IPs.

Action Required:

If HAProxy is deployed without SLB, network rules must be updated across environments.

Using SLB in front of HAProxy avoids this disruption (IP continuity, minimal changes).




---

3.3 High Availability & Scalability

SLB Advantage: Native multi-AZ redundancy and auto-scaling.

HAProxy Requirement:

Deploy at least two HAProxy nodes across AZs.

Implement failover mechanisms (e.g., Keepalived, VRRP, DNS, etc.).

Design for load distribution and scalability.




---

3.4 Monitoring & Operations

Impact: Moving from managed SLB to self-hosted HAProxy increases operational responsibility.

Required Actions:

Set up monitoring and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).

Regular updates, log management, SSL renewal handled in-house.




---

3.5 TLS Termination & Security

Impact: Managed SLBs may handle TLS termination and basic DDoS/WAF protections.

Actions:

Implement TLS termination in HAProxy, including certificate management.

Review DDoS protection options (e.g., upstream filtering, rate limiting).




---

4. Recommended Architecture Adjustment

To ensure compatibility with TrafficManager and maintain routing and failover mechanisms, the best approach is:

> Deploy HAProxy instances behind a lightweight SLB, which remains the registered member in TrafficManager.



This preserves DNS-based failover while gaining routing control and flexibility with HAProxy.
